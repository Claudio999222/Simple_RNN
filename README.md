# Simple_RNN

## Overview

In this notebook, we will train a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model. The primary objective is to demonstrate the use of SimpleRNN layers within the neural network architecture.

## Key Objectives:

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Load and prepare the dataset suitable for a sequential data task. Consider the input features and target variable.

2. **Data Normalization**: Normalize the dataset to facilitate training, ensuring all input sequences are on a standard scale.

3. **Model Architecture**: Create a neural network architecture with SimpleRNN layers. Define the structure, including input shape, SimpleRNN layer(s), and output layer.

4. **Model Training**: Train the RNN model on the prepared dataset. Monitor training metrics such as loss and accuracy.

5. **Results Illustration**: Visualize the training results, including loss and accuracy curves over epochs. Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.
